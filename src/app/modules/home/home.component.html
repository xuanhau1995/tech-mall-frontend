            Apple Products Are No Longer On Sale In Russia, As Sanctions Gather
            Up Against The Country

            As sanctions continue to pile up against Russia against its attack
            on Russia, Apple has announced that it has stopped selling its
            products through its Apple Stores in the country. Other businesses
            of Western origin have taken similar actions as Russia continues its
            attack on Ukraine. Businesses, banks, and global financial
            institutions are cutting ties off with the country.
